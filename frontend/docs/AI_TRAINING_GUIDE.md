### 2. AI Personality Engine (`aiPersonalityEngine.js`)
**Purpose**: Adapts AI behavior based on student's mental health status
**Personalities**:
- **Encouraging** (Minimal depression/anxiety): Upbeat, celebratory
- **Supportive** (Mild symptoms): Warm, understanding
- **Gentle** (Moderate symptoms): Soft, patient
- **Caring** (Moderately severe): Compassionate, deep empathy
- **Crisis** (Severe symptoms): Urgent care, safety-focused

### 3. Mental Health Educator (`mentalHealthEducator.js`)
**Purpose**: Provides educational content and explanations
**Content Areas**:
- Depression understanding and coping
- Anxiety management and education
- Stress recognition and management
- Assessment result explanations
- Crisis resources and support

## Training the AI Guide

### Step 1: Assessment-Based Adaptation

The AI adapts its personality based on the student's latest assessment results:

```javascript
// Assessment data structure
{
  percentage: 75,           // Wellness score (0-100)
  severity: 'mild',         // minimal, mild, moderate, moderately_severe, severe
  aiPersonality: 'supportive', // AI personality to use
  completedAt: '2025-09-21',
  score: 5                  // Raw assessment score
}
```

**Training Instructions**:
1. **Encouraging Personality** (80-100% wellness):
   - Use enthusiastic, positive language
   - Focus on growth and achievements
   - Encourage sharing success strategies
   - Vocabulary: "wonderful", "fantastic", "amazing"

2. **Supportive Personality** (60-79% wellness):
   - Warm, understanding tone
   - Focus on daily life and routine
   - Gentle guidance and practical advice
   - Vocabulary: "understand", "support", "helpful"

3. **Gentle Personality** (40-59% wellness):
   - Soft, patient approach
   - Focus on feelings and small steps
   - Validate emotions frequently
   - Vocabulary: "gentle", "patience", "step by step"

4. **Caring Personality** (20-39% wellness):
   - Compassionate, deep empathy
   - Focus on professional help and safety
   - Provide comprehensive support
   - Vocabulary: "care deeply", "valid", "strength"

5. **Crisis Personality** (0-19% wellness):
   - Urgent but caring tone
   - Immediate safety focus
   - Crisis intervention approach
   - Vocabulary: "immediate", "safety", "help available"

### Step 2: Contextual Assistance

The AI provides help based on the student's current location:

```javascript
// Page-based context
const contextualHelp = {
  '/student/assessment': 'Assessment guidance and encouragement',
  '/student/chat': 'Chat feature explanation and support',
  '/student/resources': 'Resource navigation help',
  '/student': 'Dashboard overview and feature explanation'
}
```

**Training Instructions**:
- Monitor user's current page
- Provide relevant, specific help
- Adapt message based on user's assessment status
- Offer proactive assistance for complex features

### Step 3: Crisis Detection and Response

The AI monitors for crisis indicators and responds appropriately:

**Crisis Keywords**: hurt myself, end it, suicide, can't go on, hopeless
**Response Protocol**:
1. Immediate acknowledgment of distress
2. Provide crisis hotline numbers
3. Encourage immediate professional help
4. Offer to stay and support until help is found
5. Never dismiss or minimize crisis situations

### Step 4: Educational Content Integration

Train the AI to use the Mental Health Educator for:

```javascript
// Example educational responses
educator.explainAssessmentResult('PHQ-9', 12)
// Returns detailed explanation of moderate depression

educator.explainWellnessScore(65)
// Returns interpretation of wellness percentage

educator.getCopingStrategies('anxiety', 'moderate')
// Returns personalized coping strategies
```

## Implementation Guide

### Adding New AI Responses

1. **Keyword Detection**:
```javascript
const detectKeywords = (message) => {
  const keywords = {
    anxiety: ['anxious', 'worry', 'nervous', 'panic'],
    depression: ['sad', 'depressed', 'hopeless', 'down'],
    stress: ['stressed', 'overwhelmed', 'pressure']
  }
  
  for (const [topic, words] of Object.entries(keywords)) {
    if (words.some(word => message.toLowerCase().includes(word))) {
      return topic
    }
  }
  return null
}
```

2. **Personalized Response Generation**:
```javascript
const generateResponse = (topic, assessmentData) => {
  const personality = getPersonality(assessmentData)
  const educator = new MentalHealthEducator()
  
  // Combine personality with educational content
  const education = educator.generateEducationalResponse(topic, assessmentData)
  const personalizedTone = personality.responseStyle
  
  return adaptToneToPersonality(education, personalizedTone)
}
```

### Enhancing Conversation Flow

1. **Memory System**: Track conversation history
2. **Follow-up Questions**: Ask relevant follow-ups
3. **Session Summaries**: Provide conversation summaries
4. **Progress Tracking**: Monitor user improvement over time

## Advanced Training Techniques

### 1. Machine Learning Integration

```javascript
// Integrate with external AI services
const enhancedResponse = await openAI.complete({
  prompt: buildAdaptedPrompt(userInput, personality, context, assessmentData),
  temperature: personality.tone === 'crisis' ? 0.3 : 0.7,
  maxTokens: 150
})
```

### 2. Sentiment Analysis

```javascript
const analyzeSentiment = (message) => {
  // Use sentiment analysis library
  const sentiment = analyzer.analyze(message)
  return {
    mood: sentiment.score > 0 ? 'positive' : 'negative',
    intensity: Math.abs(sentiment.score),
    emotions: sentiment.emotions
  }
}
```

### 3. Adaptive Learning

```javascript
// Learn from successful interactions
const trackInteractionSuccess = (response, userFeedback) => {
  if (userFeedback.helpful) {
    // Store successful response patterns
    learningDatabase.store({
      personality: currentPersonality,
      context: currentContext,
      response: response,
      success: true
    })
  }
}
```
